Answer the question: Who is the detective that earned most money in 2022?

### Use below query to ingest data into ADX Cluster :

```kusto
.execute database script <|
// Create a table for the telemetry data:
.create table DetectiveCases(Timestamp:datetime, EventType:string, DetectiveId:string, CaseId: string, Properties:dynamic)
// Load the data:
.ingest async into table DetectiveCases (@'https://kustodetectiveagency.blob.core.windows.net/kda2start/log_00000.csv.gz')
.ingest async into table DetectiveCases (@'https://kustodetectiveagency.blob.core.windows.net/kda2start/log_00001.csv.gz')
.ingest into table DetectiveCases (@'https://kustodetectiveagency.blob.core.windows.net/kda2start/log_00002.csv.gz')
```
## Solution

```kusto
let bounty_details = DetectiveCases
| where EventType == "CaseOpened"
| extend Bounty = toreal(Properties.Bounty)
| project CaseId, Bounty;
DetectiveCases
| where isempty(Properties)
| join kind = inner bounty_details on CaseId
| summarize sum(Bounty) by DetectiveId
| order by sum_Bounty
```
